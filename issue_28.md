# Support collapsible sections in preview

## Collapsible sections

You can create a collapsible section (sometimes called an accordion) that is hidden by default. The user can click the title to expand or collapse the section.

Collapsible text can be used to simplify complex content, such as streamlining an FAQ page or de-cluttering a complex procedure with nested lists. For example, instead of displaying a set of sub-steps, you can collapse the sub-steps into a "View details" section.

## Syntax

+++Click me
This is text inside a collapsible section.

- Bullet one
- Bullet two
- Bullet three

+++

This text is after the collapsible section, so it should disappear when you click on the +++ in the preview.

+++ Do not click me

This section does not start immediately after the collapsible text.

| Column A | Column B | Column C |

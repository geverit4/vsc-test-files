# Test for the behavior of MD036

The default value for this is "false", so the **My documents** below should not be flagged for an error. 

MD036 - Emphasis used instead of a heading
Tags: headings, headers, emphasis

Aliases: no-emphasis-as-heading, no-emphasis-as-header

Parameters: punctuation (string; default ".,;:!?。，；：！？")

This check looks for instances where emphasized (i.e. bold or italic) text is used to separate sections, where a heading should be used instead:

**My document**

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

_Another section_

Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
To fix this, use Markdown headings instead of emphasized text to denote sections:

# My document

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

## Another section

Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
Note: This rule looks for single-line paragraphs that consist entirely of emphasized text. It won't fire on emphasis used within regular text, multi-line emphasized paragraphs, or paragraphs ending in punctuation (normal or full-width). Similarly to rule MD026, you can configure what characters are recognized as punctuation.
